# learn-shell

This repository is created to add all the bascis and learnings related to shell & bash scripting.

Shell is native to linux, yon can achieve most of the functional requirements straight forward.


1) We will create an instance and on the top of it we will keep all 3 tier in a single, just for the sake of automation


How to run a script
# bash scriptName  ( ensure you're on the path where the script existis )
# ./scriptName     ( ensure you're on the path where the script existis )



Functional Requirement     : Know driving a car 
Non-Fucntional Requirement : Knowing Rules, when to stop, when to start, which side of the road to go, renew the car tag, emission tag, vin  number 


### Any coding standards should fulfil all of this ( NFR )
1) Code should always be dry                                        ( That means there should no repeatable code ) 
2) Secrets should not hardcoded in the code                         (  Usernames & Password should never be inside the code )
3) When you run the same code more than once, it should not fail    



# Case Standard:
1) STUDENT_NAMES 
2) studentNames   ( camelCase )
3) StudentNames   ( SnakeCase )
